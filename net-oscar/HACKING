Random notes for working on the Net::OSCAR source:
(*NOT* for people merely writing programs which *use* Net::OSCAR!)
(This stuff is subject to change without notice.)

-We work with TLVs as hashes which treat their keys as numbers.
To get one of these magic hashrefs, call tlv to get a blank one
or: tlv(1 => "data", 2 => "other data").  encode_tlv($tlv) before sending
it out over the wire.

-For things that should usually be a number but should be presented
to the user as a string, use dualvar(num, "string").  A lot of the
things in OSCAR/Common.pm are dualvars.

-Things in OSCAR/Common.pm that are easy to forget to update:
	EXPORT_TAGS
		Add something to EXPORT_TAGS all if you add a new thing.
		Things that should be visible to users of Net::OSCAR
		also go in EXPORT_TAGS standard.  Be careful when
		naming things that will go in standard, since they'll
		be imported into the namespace of most programs which
		use Net::OSCAR.
	CONNTYPE_FOO
		Add one of these if you add something that requires a
		new connection type.  Also add it to svcmap in
		OSCAR/Callbacks.pm.
	OSCAR_TOOLDATA
		This probably also needs to get updated if you
		add a new connection type, or maybe even a new family.
	BUDTYPES
		If you're using a new type, in the BLInternal sense of
		the word, put it in this ugly little array, padding
		it with "unknown N" if necessary.

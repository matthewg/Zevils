<h1>About UDRP Wizard</h1>
<h2><a href="udrpwiz.pl">Run UDRP Wizard</a></h2>
<p>
UDRP Wizard is an expert system for the <a href="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp.htm">Uniform Domain-Name Dispute Resolution Policy</a>.
It's designed to guide the user through a series of relatively simple questions.  Answering these questions provides the UDRP Wizard with enough information to determine whether
a particular domain could be transferred under the policies of the UDRP and the precedent established by the existing body of UDRP cases, and why or why not.
</p><p>
<b>This is an experimental system.  The output of this system does not constitute legal advice.  Neither UDRP Wizard nor its author are licensed to practice law.</b>  Amongst its limitations, there are a few notable ones:
</p><ul>
<li>So far, only a limited amount of precedent has been examined in constructing the system.</li>
<li>The translation of the UDRP and UDRP case law into an automated system was not performed by an expert in UDRP cases.</li>
<li>UDRP Wizard only works for cases where the disputed mark is a registered trademark; it doesn't attempt to take into account the possibility of "common-law trademarks", such as geographic/place names or personal names.</li>
<li>UDRP Wizard doesn't attempt to address the issue of evidentiary support.  This is particularly relevant in the area of 'legitimate use'.  There seems to be some confusion over which party has the burden of proving that the Respondent does or does not have a legitimate interest in the domain.  See <a href="http://arbiter.wipo.int/domains/decisions/html/2000/d2000-0624.html">Do The Hustle, LLC v. Tropic Web; WIPO case D2000-0624</a> for more information on this.</li>
</ul>

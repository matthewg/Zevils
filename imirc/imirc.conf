# This should go in either /etc/aimirc.conf or ~/.aimirc

### Basic Configuration 
###
### The following configuration options MUST be changed!

$verbose_signon = 0;		#Send a lot of info to a user when they signon

$us = "aimserv.zevils.com";	#IRC server name to claim to be
				#This should be the same as the servername
				#in the C/N lines you made in your IRC server's
				#ircd.conf.

$them = "127.0.0.1";		#Hostname/IP of IRC server to connect to
$themport = 6667;		#Port of IRC server to connect to

$ourpass = "foo";		#Password to send to the IRC server.
				#Note that this is also the key for
				# #aimirc-debug.

$theirpass = "bar";		#Password to expect from the IRC server.

$servermode = "dal2";		#Should be either dal2, dragonfire, ircu, ts, or
				#rfc.  dal2 is for the Dalnet protocol which is
				#used by a bunch of irc daemons, including
				#Cyclone.  ircu is for the Undernet IRC daemon.
				#ts uses the TimeStamp protocol, which is used
				#by IRC daemons such as Hybrid.
				#rfc uses the IRC protocol sepecifed in RFC 1459.


$connectmode = 1;		#This controls how we handle AIM connections.
				#Set this to 1 to have all AIM connections in
				#the same process as everything else.
				#
				#Set it to 2 to fork off a seperate process for
				#each AIM connection.
				#
				#Leaving it a 0 (recommended) will let aimirc
				#decide what to use.  It will use forking if
				#available.
				#
				#Fork mode is not currently functional - do not
				#change this value.

### IRC/Interface preferences

$prefix = "AIM-";	#Prefix attached to AOL Instant Messenger nicks

$usnick = "AIMServ";	#IRC nickname which users use to communicate with aimirc

$time = 60*5;		#Number of seconds after which an away message can be
			#sent twice to the same user.  60*5 is 5 minutes.

###
### SSL preferences

###
### Debugging/administration settings

		#Note that if this is set to 0, administrative commands will be
		#unavailable as #aimirc-debug is required for the
		#administrative commands..

#Debug levels.  You can set these to 1 for less verbosity, or 0 to
#turn them off entirely.

AOL Instant Messenger is a trademark of America Online.

Requirements:
	perl 5.004 or better
	A working IRC server with C/N lines for aimirc
		Your IRC server might not work with aimirc.  Cyclone,
		Dragonfire, and I believe Undernet IRCD are the only ones that are
		known to work.  It should also work with anything that uses RFC-standard
		SERVER and USER/NICK protocols.  However, if you email me or contact me on
		AOL Instant Messenger or IRC,  I will try to help you get aimirc working with
		your IRC server.

		Cyclone is available from ftp://ftp.slashnet.org/pub/cyclone

	The HTML-Tree modules from CPAN (HTML::Parse, HTML::FormatText).

Installation:
	Untar the tarball.  This creates a directory called aimirc-XX where
XX is the version number of aimirc that you downloaded.  Open the aimirc
file in a text editor.  Near the top of the file are several variables,
$us, $them, $themport, $ourpass, $theirpass, and $servermode.  $us is the
IRC server name that you want to call the aimirc server.  $them is the IP or
hostname for the IRC server to connect to.  $themport is the port to connect
to on the IRC server.  $ourpass and $theirpass should be set to your IRC
server passwords.  $servermode should be the type of your server.  Currently,
the only supported types are dal2 and dragonfire.

	You need C/N lines for aimirc set up in your ircd.conf.  Mine look
like this:
	C:127.0.0.1:password:aimserv.matthewg.port.net::50
	N:127.0.0.1:password:aimserv.matthewg.port.net::50

	Now you should be able to run aimirc.

Usage:
	You need an AOL Instant Messenger account.
	Let's say your AIM account is tocname and the password is tocpass.
	To connect to AIM: /msg aimserv signon tocname tocpass
	To send an Instant Message to MattSachs: /msg AIM-MattSachs hi
	To get help on additional commands: /msg aimserv help

	To set yourself away on AIM, use the normal IRC /away command.  Anyone
	contacting you while you are away will get an autoreply containing
	your away message.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
	To see debugging information, join #aimirc-debug.  You must have $debug
	set to 1 in the config file for this to work.

	The key to this channel is the same as the value given in the config
	file for $ourpass (that is, the password that aimirc sends to the upstream
	IRC server.)  This isn't the greatest security in the world, as anyone in
	#aimirc-debug can see the password of anyone signing onto AIM through your
	aimserv, any IMs sent or received, etc.  You should almost definately set
	up ChanServ on that channel if you have one.

	#aimirc-debug can also be used to send a few administrative commands, such as
	restart, to aimirc.

	There's a mailing list and a CVS tree.

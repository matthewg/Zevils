AOL Instant Messenger and AOL are a trademarks of America Online.

Requirements:
	perl 5.004 or better (5.6.1 or better strongly recommended)
	A working IRC server with C/N lines for IMIRC
		Your IRC server might not work with IMIRC.  Bahamut, Cyclone,
		Dragonfire, Undernet IRCD, TS irc servers such as Hybrid, Unreal,
		and irc.org 2.10 and possibly 2.9 are the only ones that are known
		to work.  It should also work with anything that uses RFC-standard
		SERVER and USER/NICK protocols.  However, if you email me or contact
		me on AOL Instant Messenger or IRC,  I will try to help you get
		IMIRC working with your IRC server.

	The modules required are available from CPAN.  See
	http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/, or do perl -MCPAN -e shell.  You
	can also just use the getmodules script to grab them.


Installation:
	Untar the tarball.  This creates a directory called imirc-XX where
XX is the version number of IMIRC that you downloaded.  Open the imirc.conf
file in a text editor.  Edit it to your satisfaction and then copy it to either
/etc/imirc.conf or ~/.imirc .  You should make sure that it is only readable
by the user that IMIRC will run as since it will contain your irc C/N
passwords in plaintext.  This can probably be accomplished by chmod 600'ing it.

	You need C/N lines for IMIRC set up in your ircd.conf.  Mine look
like this:
	C:127.0.0.1:password:imserv.your_irc_network.com::50
	N:127.0.0.1:password:imserv.your_irc_network.com::50

	You also need Q: lines for $usnick, $oldnick, and $prefix*:
	Q:IMServ:Reserved for IMIRC
	Q:AIMServ:Reserved for IMIRC
	Q:AIM-*:Reserved for IMIRC

	Now you should be able to run IMIRC.  If you want to make your IMIRC
	available to the public, go to
	http://www.zevils.com/programs/imirc/imstat/ and add yourself to the
	networks list.

	For information on dealing with nickname length limitations,
	see the file README.ircu - it applies to many other IRC servers,
	not just ircu.

	Another issue is services.  Read README.services if you are using
	services or any other sort of system bots!

Troubleshooting:
	If you get a permission denied error while trying to run imirc or
	getmodules, try the following command: chmod +x imirc getmodules

	If you get an error about a bad interpreter while trying to run
	getmodules or imirc, your perl may not be installed in /usr/bin/perl.
	Find out where your perl binary is located; try commands like
	'which perl', 'type -path perl', 'whereis perl', and
	'locate perl | grep bin'.  Then, change the first line of getmodules
	and imirc from #!/usr/bin/perl to #!/path/to/your/perl

	If you get an error like 'mkdir /root/.cpan: Permission denied at
	CPAN.pm' while running getmodules, find where your system-wide
	CPAN configuration file is by looking at the line immediately above
	that error; it should contain something like
	'/usr/lib/perl5/CPAN/Config.pm OK'.  Then run the following commands:
		mkdir ~/.cpan/CPAN
		cat /path/to/CPAN.pm | sed s%/root/.cpan%$HOME/.cpan% > \
			~/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm
	Then run getmodules again.

Usage:
	You need an AOL Instant Messenger account.
	Let's say your AIM account is SomeDude and the password is SomePass.
	To connect to AIM: /msg IMServ signon SomeDude SomePass
	To send an Instant Message to MattSachs: /msg AIM-MattSachs hi
	To get help on additional commands: /msg IMServ help

	To set yourself away on AIM, use the normal IRC /away command.  Anyone
	contacting you while you are away will get an autoreply containing
	your away message.

	If you are using Cyclone, you must add a U: line for AIMServ.
	The syntax is U:servername:*:*

IMPORTANT NOTE:
	To see debugging information, join #imirc-debug.  You must have $debug
	set to 1 in the config file for this to work.

	The key to this channel is the same as the value given in the config
	file for $ourpass (that is, the password that IMIRC sends to the
	upstream IRC server.)  This isn't the greatest security in the world,
	as anyone in #imirc-debug can see the password of anyone signing onto
	AIM through your IMServ, any IMs sent or received, etc.  You should
	almost definately set up ChanServ on that channel if you have one.

	#imirc-debug can also be used to send a few administrative commands,
	such as restart, to IMIRC.  It can also be used to execute arbitrary
	perl code.  **MAKE SURE #imirc-debug IS ADEQUATELY PROTECTED IF YOU
	ABSOLUTELY MUST TURN DEBUGGING ON!!!**

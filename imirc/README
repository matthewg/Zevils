Requirements:
	perl 5.004 or better
	A working IRC server with C/N lines for aimirc
		Your IRC server might not work with aimirc.  Cyclone,
		Dragonfire, Undernet IRCD, and TS irc servers such as Hybrid
		are the only ones that are known to work.  It should also work
		with anything that uses RFC-standard SERVER and USER/NICK
		protocols.  However, if you email me or contact me on AOL
		Instant Messenger or IRC,  I will try to help you get aimirc
		working with your IRC server.

		Cyclone is available from ftp://ftp.slashnet.org/pub/cyclone

	The HTML-Tree and HTML-Format modules from CPAN (HTML::Parse,
	HTML::FormatText).  These are availabe from
	http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/HTML/ .

Installation:
	Untar the tarball.  This creates a directory called aimirc-XX where
XX is the version number of aimirc that you downloaded.  Open the aimirc.conf
file in a text editor.  Edit it to your satisfaction and then copy it to either
/etc/aimirc.conf or ~/.aimirc .  You should make sure that it is only readable
by the user that aimirc will run as since it will contain your irc C/N
passwords in plaintext.  This can probably be accomplished by chmod 600'ing it.

	You need C/N lines for aimirc set up in your ircd.conf.  Mine look
like this:
	C:127.0.0.1:password:aimserv.your_irc_network.com::50
	N:127.0.0.1:password:aimserv.your_irc_network.com::50

	Now you should be able to run aimirc.

Usage:
	You need an AOL Instant Messenger account.
	Let's say your AIM account is tocname and the password is tocpass.
	To connect to AIM: /msg aimserv signon tocname tocpass
	To send an Instant Message to MattSachs: /msg AIM-MattSachs hi
	To get help on additional commands: /msg aimserv help

	To set yourself away on AIM, use the normal IRC /away command.  Anyone
	contacting you while you are away will get an autoreply containing
	your away message.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
	To see debugging information, join #aimirc-debug.  You must have $debug
	set to 1 in the config file for this to work.

	The key to this channel is the same as the value given in the config
	file for $ourpass (that is, the password that aimirc sends to the
	upstream IRC server.)  This isn't the greatest security in the world,
	as anyone in #aimirc-debug can see the password of anyone signing onto
	AIM through your aimserv, any IMs sent or received, etc.  You should
	almost definately set up ChanServ on that channel if you have one.

	#aimirc-debug can also be used to send a few administrative commands,
	such as restart, to aimirc.  It can also be used to execute arbitrary
	perl code.  **MAKE SURE #aimirc-debug IS ADEQUATELY PROTECTED IF YOU
	ABSOLUTELY MUST TURN DEBUGGING ON!!!**

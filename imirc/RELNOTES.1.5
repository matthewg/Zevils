Starting with release 1.5, the software formerly known as AIMIRC or aimirc is now
called IMIRC.  The default values of some parameters which directly affect users
have changed.  The IMIRC IRC user is now called IMServ instead of AIMServ by
default.

The $oldname configuration parameter can be used to transition users
from an old name, such as AIMServ (which is the default value of $oldname) to the
new name.

Also, instead of #aimirc-screenname, we now use #aimchan-screenname.
This is because in the future we will support other protocols, and they will have
separate namespaces (such as #icqchan-screenname.)

The main program script is imirc, not aimirc.

Starting with release 1.5, the software formerly known as AIMIRC or aimirc is now
called IMIRC.  The default values of some parameters which directly affect users
have changed.  The IMIRC IRC user is now called IMServ instead of AIMServ by
default.  The debugging channel is #imirc-debug instead of #aimirc-debug.
Please update your Q:lines and other security measures appropriately.

The $oldname configuration parameter can be used to transition users
from an old name, such as AIMServ (which is the default value of $oldname) to the
new name.

Also, instead of #aimirc-screenname, we now use #aimchan-screenname.
This is because in the future we will support other protocols, and they will have
separate namespaces (such as #icqchan-screenname.)

The main program script is imirc, not aimirc.

There are a couple of new options that make us cooperate better with services.
By default, any nicks coming from servers whose names start with servers. will
be ignored, as will nicks coming from servers which have U: lines.  You can
change the $ignoreuhosts and @ignorehosts parameters to modify this behavior.

IMIRC now, by default, enforces the recommended Q: lines.

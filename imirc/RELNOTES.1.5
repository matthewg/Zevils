Starting with release 1.5, the software formerly known as AIMIRC or aimirc is now
called IMIRC.  The default values of some parameters which directly affect users
have changed.  The IMIRC IRC user is now called IMServ instead of AIMServ by
default.  The debugging channel is #imirc-debug instead of #aimirc-debug.
Please update your Q:lines and other security measures appropriately.

The $oldname configuration parameter can be used to transition users
from an old name, such as AIMServ (which is the default value of $oldname) to the
new name.

Also, instead of #aimirc-screenname, we now use #aimchan-screenname.
This is because in the future we will support other protocols, and they will have
separate namespaces (such as #icqchan-screenname.)

The main program script is imirc, not aimirc.

There are a couple of new options that make us cooperate better with services.
By default, any nicks coming from servers whose names start with servers. will
be ignored, as will nicks coming from servers which have U: lines.  You can
change the $ignoreuhosts and @ignorehosts parameters to modify this behavior.

IMIRC now, by default, enforces the recommended Q: lines.  This can be turned
off via the require_qlines config parameter.  It also, as a backup,
will KILL anyone whose NICK starts with $prefix (which should never happen unless
your Q: lines aren't working or you've turned off require_qlines.)  This killing
can be disabled via the kill_impersonaters config parameter - which might be a good
idea if you have prefix set to "" (which isn't a recommended configuration,
by the way.)

NOTICEs can be used instead of PRIVMSG to IM people.  If the recipient is using
IMIRC, they will receive the IM as a NOTICE instead of a PRIVMSG.  CTCPs can also
be sent over AIM to IMIRC users.  However, this is a security risk; scenarios
involving networks of AIM bots ping-flooding people and then warning them come
to mind.  Thus CTCP-over-AIM is off by default.  It can be enabled via the set ctcp
command.

There is a new IMServ command, relnotes.  The first time someone signs on to AIM
with IMIRC 1.5, they will be told that they have unseen release notes and they
should use the relnotes command.  They can use this command to see the important
user-visible changes in the new version.

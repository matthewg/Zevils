Crypto support (SSH?) for talking to another aimirc client?
	Well, for talking to any client really, but I don't think that the
	standard clients will be including this anytime soon ;)

	Encrypt the contents of any IM's to selected clients or chats to
	selected chatrooms.

	This still wouldn't encrypt the client->IRC server connection, but
	that's what SSH forwarding is for.

	Maybe better/easier than SSH would be exchanging a OTP with the
	client.  The OTP would be encrypted using the target's PGP/GPG
	public key.  Is this secure?

	Are there any crypto Perl modules?

	I'm in the US.  Shall I just give the crypto export restrictions the
	civil disobedience they deserve?  Or maybe someone outside the US
	would be willing to maintain a set of crypto patches.

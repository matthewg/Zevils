Admin:
	#aimirc-admin -- seperate from #aimirc-debug
	Allow admins to be authenticated by any one of the following methods:
		being in #aimirc-admin (+k)
			let pass be set independantly of $uspass
		being an IRC operator (all-global, all-local, and/or
		  local-on-upstream
		sending /msg aimserv admin ($adminpass || $uspass)

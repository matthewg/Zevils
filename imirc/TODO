Unclassified:
	Write a TOC server and a set of stress tests and regression tests.

Real Soon Now:
	server-side buddylist backups, server-side profile saving, and pounces.
		Add profile info to OSCAR savebuddies/loadbuddies
		Write to disk when we shut down and also every $checkpoint minutes
		Config options (defaults):
			$dcc (1) - allow DCC (savebuddies/loadbuddies)
			$savebuddies (1) - keep buddylist backups on disk
			$saveprofiles (1) - keep profiles on disk
			$savepounces (1) - save pounces on disk
			$checkpoint (60) - write to disk every N minutes (<= 0 disables)
			$directory ($home/.aimirc/) - where to store the files
		Notify how many pounces they have on signon
		Notify if restoring buddylist from backup on signon
		Notify if setting profile on signon
		Pounce commands:
			add_pounce screenname text
			remove_pounce number
			list_pounces
		We keep everything in memory (hashes) and only write to disk when we checkpoint
	"Short-circuiting"
		When sending an IM, check to see if the target is signed onto
		the local aimirc.  If so, don't go through TOC.
			$shortcircuit config option (default on)
			%irc_connections - keys are normalized screennames, values are normalized IRC nicks
	Support %x escapes in profiles
	Add support for Undernet P10 protocol, Unreal IRCd
	TOC PAUSE
	Make more mention of the fact that you need to set_info after
	  every signon in documentation/help message. - only if server-side-saves disabled
	AWAY tracking for everyone, not just keys %aim_connections
		This prevents the following from causing IRC/AIM away desynch:
			:SomeDude AWAY :foo
			:SomeDude PRIVMSG AIMServ :signon SomeDude SomePass
		by keeping track of AWAY for IRCers who haven't signed on.
	ChanServ/AIMServ conflict
		MODE loop detection, README.ChanServ, services patches

Probably/Second Priority:
	#buddies-SCREENNAME (geniusj)
	Write a help intro/overview

Pending/Maybe:
	(#aimirc-debug or IRC or AIMServ?) stats command
	file transfer -> DCC?
	Handle colors as well as bold, etc.?
	Code cleanup? (Where?)
	Ability to join chatrooms in different exchange

Wishlist:
	Fix #aimirc-debug reload command

In Progress:
	Multiple buddies at once in add_buddy/remove_buddy
	Minimize "flashing"

Real Soon Now:
	savebuddies/loadbuddies for buddylist backup
		CTCP SAVEBUDDIES, CTCP LOADBUDDIES for scriptability
			As long as we're add it, support other CTCPs?
	Add support for Undernet P10 protocol, Unreal IRCd
	TOC PAUSE
	Make more mention of the fact that you need to set_info after
	  every signon in documentation/help message.
	AWAY tracking for everyone, not just keys %aim_connections
		This prevents the following from causing IRC/AIM away desynch:
			:SomeDude AWAY :foo
			:SomeDude PRIVMSG AIMServ :signon SomeDude SomePass
		by keeping track of AWAY for IRCers who haven't signed on.

Pending/Maybe:
	(#aimirc-debug or IRC or AIMServ?) stats command
	file transfer -> DCC?
	Handle colors as well as bold, etc.?
	Code cleanup? (Where?)
	Default set_info?

Wishlist:
	Fix #aimirc-debug reload command

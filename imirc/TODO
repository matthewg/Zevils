*DOUBLE POUNCES MUST DIE!!*

loadbuddies DCC w/ mIRC

*WHY ISN'T THIS PARSED RIGHT:*
	<blah>test<BR><test>2<BR><yoyo>3

Rethink checkpointing?
	Don't always keep everything in memory
	Don't write unless dirty
	Options to delete old unused data??

Real Soon Now/First Priority:
	ChanServ/AIMServ conflict
		MODE loop detection, README.ChanServ, services patches
	Undernet P10 ircd support

Probably/Second Priority:
	#buddies-SCREENNAME (geniusj)
	Write a help intro/overview
	Internationalization
		Store strings in a data file (hash - probably eval'd)
		Translate docs too?
			Might as well.
		Hmm, I guess I could try to do a Spanish translation...
		Pig-latin translation!
		set_lang command - Make it sticky
			$directory/preferences/screenname
				Other preferences?
		use locale

Maybe/Third Priority:
	(#aimirc-debug or IRC or AIMServ?) stats command
	file transfer -> DCC?
	Handle colors as well as bold, etc.?
	Write a TOC server and a set of stress tests and regression tests.

Wishlist:
	Fix #aimirc-debug reload command

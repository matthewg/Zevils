Damn, bloody thing uses too much CPU...
I think its these constant read attempts on the AIM connections.  Plus it has
to set up the SIGALRM stuff too (well it doesn't /have to/ - it /does/).  Maybe
turn off alarm for the first character, or maybe FIONREAD?  FIONREAD capability
would need to be autodetected for portability.

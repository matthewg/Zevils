Real Soon Now/First Priority:
	TOC PAUSE
	Make more mention of the fact that you need to set_info after
	  every signon in documentation/help message. - only if server-side-saves disabled
	ChanServ/AIMServ conflict
		MODE loop detection, README.ChanServ, services patches

Probably/Second Priority:
	#buddies-SCREENNAME (geniusj)
	Write a help intro/overview
	Internationalization
		Store strings in a data file (hash - probably eval'd)
		Translate docs too?
			Might as well.
		Hmm, I guess I could try to do a Spanish translation...
		Pig-latin translation!
		set_lang command - Make it sticky
			$directory/preferences/screenname
				Other preferences?
		use locale

Maybe/Third Priority:
	(#aimirc-debug or IRC or AIMServ?) stats command
	file transfer -> DCC?
	Handle colors as well as bold, etc.?
	Code cleanup? (Where?)
	Write a TOC server and a set of stress tests and regression tests.

Wishlist:
	Fix #aimirc-debug reload command

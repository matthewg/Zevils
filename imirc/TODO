Unclassified:
	Write a TOC server and a set of stress tests and regression tests.

Real Soon Now:
	server-side buddylist backups, server-side profile saving, and pounces.
		Add profile info to OSCAR savebuddies/loadbuddies
		Write to disk when we shut down and also every $checkpoint minutes
		Config options (defaults):
			$dcc (1) - allow DCC (savebuddies/loadbuddies)
			$savebuddies (1) - keep buddylist backups on disk
			$saveprofiles (1) - keep profiles on disk
			$savepounces (1) - save pounces on disk
			$checkpoint (60) - write to disk every N minutes (<= 0 disables)
			$directory ($home/.aimirc/) - where to store the files
		Notify how many pounces they have on signon
		Notify if restoring buddylist from backup on signon
		Notify if setting profile on signon
		Pounce commands:
			add_pounce screenname text
			remove_pounce number
			list_pounces
		We keep everything in memory (hashes) and only write to disk when we checkpoint
	Add support for Undernet P10 protocol, Unreal IRCd
	TOC PAUSE
	Make more mention of the fact that you need to set_info after
	  every signon in documentation/help message. - only if server-side-saves disabled
	ChanServ/AIMServ conflict
		MODE loop detection, README.ChanServ, services patches

Probably/Second Priority:
	#buddies-SCREENNAME (geniusj)
	Write a help intro/overview

Pending/Maybe:
	(#aimirc-debug or IRC or AIMServ?) stats command
	file transfer -> DCC?
	Handle colors as well as bold, etc.?
	Code cleanup? (Where?)

Wishlist:
	Fix #aimirc-debug reload command

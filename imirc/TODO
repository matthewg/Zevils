#aimirc-screenname DCC (loadbuddies)/multinick
#aimirc-screenname and multinick in general
/msg #aimirc-screenname aim-somedude hey

Showstoppers (absolutely must be done before 0.98):
	ChanServ/AIMServ conflict - MODE loop detection, README.ChanServ, services patches
	Am I using ircify in all the right places?
	Make sure we're always timing out connections, esp. DCC
	Undernet P10 ircd support

Pretty Important (should be done before 0.98, definately before 0.99):
	buddy notes/subgroups
	Preferences System
		buddy list formatting controls
		sending NOTICE
	Test loadbuddies DCC w/ mIRC
	Write a help intro/overview
	Debugging Enhancements
		Personal Debugging - AIMServ debug commands debug yourself
		#aimirc-debug ability to debug a specific AIM connection

Tier 1 Enhancements (before 0.99 would be nice):
	Internationalization [maybe do only partially before 0.99]
		Store strings in a data file (hash - probably eval'd)
		Translate docs too?
			Might as well.
		Hmm, I guess I could try to do a Spanish translation...
		set_lang command - Make it sticky
		use locale

Tier 2 Enhancements (quite possibly post-1.0):
	File Transfer -> DCC
	Hot Chats grabber
	Color support

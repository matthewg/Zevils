Unclassified:
	Write a TOC server and a set of stress tests and regression tests.

Bugs:
	Reports of miscellaneous reaping problems

Real Soon Now:
	savebuddies/loadbuddies for buddylist backup
		CTCP SAVEBUDDIES, CTCP LOADBUDDIES for scriptability
			As long as we're add it, support other CTCPs?
	Add support for Undernet P10 protocol, Unreal IRCd
	TOC PAUSE
	Make more mention of the fact that you need to set_info after
	  every signon in documentation/help message.
	AWAY tracking for everyone, not just keys %aim_connections
		This prevents the following from causing IRC/AIM away desynch:
			:SomeDude AWAY :foo
			:SomeDude PRIVMSG AIMServ :signon SomeDude SomePass
		by keeping track of AWAY for IRCers who haven't signed on.
	ChanServ/AIMServ conflict
		MODE loop detection, README.ChanServ, services patches

Probably/Second Priority:
	#buddies-SCREENNAME (geniusj)


Pending/Maybe:
	(#aimirc-debug or IRC or AIMServ?) stats command
	file transfer -> DCC?
	Handle colors as well as bold, etc.?
	Code cleanup? (Where?)
	Default set_info?
	Ability to join chatrooms in different exchange
	"Short-circuiting"
		When sending an IM, check to see if the target is signed onto
		the local aimirc.  If so, don't go through TOC.

Wishlist:
	Fix #aimirc-debug reload command

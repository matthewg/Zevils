.TH MP3INFO 1 "December 2003" "mp3tools 1.5" "Matthew Sachs"
.SH NAME
mp3info \- get information about MPEG audio files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mp3info
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIFILE\fR...
.TP
If called without any options, mp3info will show information about the selected
file.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-plain\fR
Filesizes will be shown as plain bytecounts instead of in human-readable
format.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-aggressive\fR
Look for the MPEG header aggressively.  You might need this for things with
weird headers, but if you do use it then it will take forever if used on
something which isn't really an MPEG audio file.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-winamp\fR
Don't use WinAmp genres.  This will only affect things if you have files with
a genre above 78.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
If you use this option, mp3info will operate in quiet mode.  Quiet mode is
designed for other programs which need to read the output of mp3info.  In
quiet mode, mp3info will print only the following:
.br
	bitrate
.br
	play length
.br
	[if there is a valid ID3 tag:]
.br
	ID3 songname
.br
	ID3 artist
.br
	ID3 album
.br
	ID3 year
.br
	ID3 comment
.br
	ID3 genre
.br
.br
Think of quiet mode as generating machine\-readable output and the default
"noisy" mode as generating human\-readable output.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-milliseconds\fR
Include milliseconds in play\-time output.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display the version and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR

Version 0.3, Feb 6  1999 - Initial release

Version 0.5, Feb 11 1999 - Removed dependency on hexdump, added support for ID3
tags, created mp3id3 program, created MP3 perl module, took care of some 
warnings, and fixed minor bug in "Artist - Title" pattern match

Version 0.7, Feb 22 1999 - Sample format greatly improved.  It now generates 
valid HTML 4.0 (at least according to http://validator.w3.org).  I was having 
some problems with it in Netscape, and those were fixed as well.  I also added
the differently-sorted indexes (by length and artist.)  The other biggy is 
switching from my MP3.pm to a module which had been in CPAN...  It's better
than mine, though.  The --delete option in mp3id3 is new.  mp3play.cgi and 
support for it in mp3index is new.  I also added an "mp3index quick start" in 
README and the EXAMPLE.  Oh, and also the CONTRIBUTORS file.  Plus I changed 
the format of this file ;0

Lots of bugfixes as well, including some serious ones.  The main one that I
can remember is that if httpurl or ftpurl didn't have a trailing slash,
Bad Things would happen.

Version 1.0, Apr 07 1999 - Removed ? option specifier from everything (meaning
the -? option is no longer equivalent to --help) as it caused problems
with older (aka 5.004, which isn't old at all) Perls.  (I'm using 5.005_54 at
the time of this writing.)  Also, I found a weird file called .swp in the
mp3tools-0.7 directory.  That file was removed for this release.  Plus I
switched to a newer MPEG::MP3Info - read the README for that to see what it
fixes.

Version 1.1, Oct 20 1999 - VBR support, mp3gui cleanup, better cross-platform
support (File::Basename), options in mp3index for multidirectory MP3 layout,
installer, manpages/htmlpages

Version 1.2, Jun 14 2000 - Small bugfixes in mp3id3 submitted by Theodore Y.
Tso: genre listing was skipping the last genre, and --no-winamp wasn't being
applied to genre listing.

Version 1.3, Oct 09 2000 - Support for ID3v1.1 track numbers in mp3id3 and
mp3gui (Dan Wallach), mp3id3 multiple files support (John Ripa), mp3gui bugfix
(Queco Jones).

Version 1.4, Jan 16 2002 - install.pl uses strict and installs into installsitebin
instead of installbin, added new sample mp3format courtesy of 
Richard van den Berg <richard@vdberg.org>, mp3index supports M3U files,
and a spurious warning was suppressed

Version 1.5, Dec 27 2003 - Add option to display milliseconds in mp3info play-time.

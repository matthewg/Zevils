If no options are given, mp3id3 will print all ID3 tags for the given file.
If no file is given, mp3id3 will list the valid genres and their number.
.TP
\fBNote on \-a, \-A, \-c, \-g, \-s, and \-y options:\fR  To set an ID3 tag,
you say something like \-\-arist=Beethoven Symphony9.mp3.  However, you can
also use the ID3 tag options to select which ID3 tags to have mp3id3 display.
But you can't just say mp3id3 \-a Symphony9.mp3.  If you do this, the program
thinks that you are trying to set the ID3 artist tag on an unnamed file.  The
proper way to do this is mp3id3 \-a "" Symphony9.mp3.

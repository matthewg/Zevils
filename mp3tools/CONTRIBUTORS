Chris Nandor (pudge@pobox.com) created the MPEG::MP3Info which this program
relies on.  A big thanks to him and everyone who worked on that module - the
solution to the same problem which MPEG::MP3Info solves which I came up with
was much less nice.

Nelson Minar (nelson@media.mit.edu) suggested the mp3play.cgi program and even
gave some code to help implement it.

Michel Verdier (mverdier@chez.com) for finding bug which required adding of
Getopt::Long::Configure("no_ignore_case").

Steven Wilcox for the ideas for the mp3gui improvements.

Alexander Zimmermann for finding the copy-n-paste error in mp3id3.

Everyone who tried the 1.1 prerelease.

I'm probably leaving some people out...

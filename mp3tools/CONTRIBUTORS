Chris Nandor (pudge@pobox.com) created the MPEG::MP3Info which this program
relies on.  A big thanks to him and everyone who worked on that module - the
solution to the same problem which MPEG::MP3Info solves which I came up with
was much less nice.

Nelson Minar (nelson@media.mit.edu) suggested the mp3play.cgi program and even
gave some code to help implement it.

Michel Verdier (mverdier@chez.com) for finding bug which required adding of
Getopt::Long::Configure("no_ignore_case").

Steven Wilcox for the ideas for the mp3gui improvements.

Alexander Zimmermann for finding the copy-n-paste error in mp3id3.

Everyone who tried the 1.1 prerelease.

Theodore Y. Tso (tytso@mit.edu) contributed a patch that fixed genre listing
in mp3id3.

Dan Wallach <dwallach@cs.rice.edu> for support for ID3v1.1 track numbers in
mp3id3.

John Ripa <jahr@home.com>, mp3id3 multiple files

Queco Jones <quecojones@netzero.net>, discovering stupid mp3gui bug

Richard van den Berg <richard@vdberg.org>, patch for mp3index VBR bug,
idea for mp3index accepting M3U files, another example of an mp3index format

Jack Angel <man@oceanography.ru>, milliseconds display in mp3info play-time

I'm probably leaving some people out...

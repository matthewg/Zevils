mp3tools-1.1: the took-me-bloody-long-enough release

This release is a ***LONG*** time coming.  I've been promising it for a while,
and it's finally out.  MPEG::MP3Info should be including VBR support in the next
release.  mp3index, mp3info, and mp3gui detect MPEG::MP3Info versions > 0.71
(the latest at time of release) and if found enable VBR support.  The sample
format will include a VBR column if you have an MPEG::MP3Info newer than 0.71.

The mp3gui code is a lot cleaner.

It should work better cross-platform, since I use File::Basename now.

It definately works if you have MP3s laid out in the mp3root/Artist/files
format.  It even works if you have a mixture of mp3root/Artist/files and
mp3root/Artist/Album/files, since I've moved my personal collection to that
format.  I've introduced new options in mp3index for this.

There are a bunch of mp3gui improvements.  It remembers what directory you
picked in the file selection widgets and it shows the filename in the mp3info
section.

Oh yes, and it's more user-friendly.  I scrapped plans for newbie stuff
(INTRODUCTION.html and the wizard) since that's the main reason it took so
long.  But there's an installer.  The installer is relatively untested, so let
me know how it goes.  There's also documentation for the individual programs in
both manpage and HTML format.

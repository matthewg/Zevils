<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>


<P>

Generate a listing for FILEs (the current directory by default).  If a format
is not named using the --format option, it must be provided on standard input.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-k</B>, <B>--keeppath</B><DD>
do not strip the paths from FILEs.  You need to do this if you keep your files
in multiple directories, but if you use this then you'll need to make sure that
the paths mp3index gets are relative to your root MP3 directory.  You can
probably do that by running mp3index ./**/*.mp3 from that directory (if you're
running bash anyway.)
<DT><B>-N</B>, <B>--noparse</B><DD>
don't parse the filename for artist and title.  You need this if you have the
artist in the ID3 tag and the title contains a dash surrounded spaces. ( - )
<DT><B>-A</B>, <B>--alternatepat=ALTPAT</B><DD>
instead of using /(.+)? - (.+)..+/ to find the artist and title from the
filename, use an alternate pattern.  You must specify a valid regular
expression with the artist in the first set of parentheses and the title in the
second.  Do not include the /slashes/.
<DT><B>-f</B>, <B>-ftpurl</B>=<I>FTPURL</I><DD>
prefix to use for FTP downloads, such as <A HREF="ftp://matthewg.port.net">ftp://matthewg.port.net</A>
<DT><B>-h</B>, <B>--httpurl=HTTPURL</B><DD>
prefix to use for HTTP downloads, such as mp3files/
<DT><B>-p</B>, <B>--playurl=MP3PLAY_URL<DD>
URL for the mp3play.cgi, such as <A HREF="http://matthewg.port.net/cgi-bin/mp3play.cgi">http://matthewg.port.net/cgi-bin/mp3play.cgi</A>
<DT>-P</B>, <B>--playall_path=PATH</B><DD>
full path and filename that the CGI to play all MP3s will be written to.  This
should end in .cgi or .pl and might need to go in your webserver's cgi-bin
directory.  You must specify this if specifying a playall_url.
<DT><B>-U</B>, <B>--playall_url=URL</B><DD>
URL for the file in playall_path.  If playall_path is
/htdocs/cgi-bin/playall.cgi, this might be <A HREF="http://yoursite/cgi-bin/playall.cgi.">http://yoursite/cgi-bin/playall.cgi.</A>
You must specify this if specifying a playall_path.
<DT><B>-o</B>, <B>--output=OUTPUT_FILE</B><DD>
You can use multiple -o options to specify multiple output files.  Your layout
file must have a subroutine for each output file.  If no output files are
given, output is written to STDOUT.
<DT><B>-d</B>, <B>--datfile=DATA_FILE</B><DD>
Specifies a data file.  See the section on data files for more information.
<DT><B>-l</B>, <B>--format=FORMAT_FILE</B><DD>
Specifies a format file (also called a layout file.)  See the section on
format files for what this should look like.  If no format file is given, 
format is read from STDIN.  mp3index must be able to find a valid format.  
Also accepts --layout for backwards compatibility.
<DT><B>-O</B>, <B>--options</B><DD>
Some formats need additional options.  See the section on format files for
details.  This should be a carrot-seperated list of options.  Each time you
specify it, it sets the options for the next output file.  --options=a^b^c
--options=x^y^z sets the first option to a, the second to b, and the third to
c for the first output file and the first, second, and third options to x, y,
and z respectively for the second output file.
<DT><B>-n</B>, <B>--no-winamp</B><DD>
Don't use WinAmp genres.  The default is to use them.  This will only affect
things if you have songs with a genre above 78.
<DT><B>-a</B>, --aggressive<DD>
Look for an MPEG header aggressively.  You might need this for things with
weird headers, but if you do use it then it will take forever if it encounters
something that isn't really an MPEG audio file.
<DT><B>-D</B>, <B>--describe</B><DD>
Describe the format file from the format descriptors in it and exit.  See the
section on format files for more information.
<DT><B>-v</B>, <B>--verbose</B><DD>
Show status information.
<DT><B>--version</B><DD>
Display the program version and exit.
<DT><B>--help</B><DD>
Show information about the program.

<H2>FORMAT FILES</H2>

Format files are what mp3index uses to determine what to make the output look
like.  They are really just normal Perl code which is evaluated at runtime.
To get the values for the various pieces of information about the files that
mp3index has access to, they use certain variables which are documented in the
README.  The only things special about them is that they must contain subroutines called
outhead, outbody, and outfoot for the first output file, outhead2, outbody2,
and outfoot2 for the second output file, etc.  outhead and outfoot are called
once at the beginning and end of a run, while outbody is called once per mp3
file.  Format files can assume that the desired output file has been selected
and opened before the output subroutines are called.  They can alter this
behavior by setting some variables at the time they are evaluated.  These are $noopen, $bodyonly, and
$passlist.  They are all set to 0 by default.  If set to 1, the first two will
prevent mp3index from opening the output file, prevent outbody and outfoot from being called.  $passlist causes outbody to be
called only once and instead of the normal variables, @list will be set to a list of hashrefs.  The keys of the hash are described in the
sample format file.
<P>
All format files must contain format descriptors.  Format descriptors let
mp3gui and mp3index give the user a description of a format file, the formats
contained in it, and the options for each format file.  See the README for
more infromation on format descriptors.

**NOTE** Starting with version 1.1, mp3tools comes with an automated
installer.  In most cases, you should use this instead of following the
instructions given below.  However, if the installer doesn't work (or if you
just want to do things by hand) you should send a bug report to
matthewg@zevils.com and then follow the instructions below.


==Installation==

Download the Perl module MPEG::MP3Info from CPAN and install it.
This can be done by ungzipping it, untarring it, changing to the directory it
creates, running "perl Makefile.PL", "make all", "make test", and, as root, 
"make install".

You'll also need CPAN's File::KGlob.  This doesn't have a nice friendly
installer.  To install File::KGlob, run perl -V and see which directories it
lists under @INC.  You'll need to make a new directory called File under one of
those directories and copy the .pm files from the File::KGlob tarball to it.

If you want to use mp3gui, you'll need the Tk module as well.  It is
available from CPAN.

You should copy mp3play.cgi somewhere where your webserver can get to it and
chmod it so it is executable (if appliciable to your filesystem) if you want
to use it.

You might also want to copy mp3index, mp3info, mp3gui, and mp3id3 to some 
place like /usr/bin.  Putting the sample format file somewhere is probably a
good idea as well.

Now go read the README and the man pages.

========REQUIREMENTS========

*perl 5.6.1 or better

*One of the supported weblogs

*The following perl modules (the CPAN distribution containing the module
is given in parentheses:)

	HTML::FormatText (HTML-Format)
	HTML::Parse (HTML-Tree)
	Regexp::Shellish (Regexp-Shellish)

See the perlmodinstall manpage (perldoc perlmodinstall) for information
on obtaining and installing modules.


========INSTALLATION========

Change into the NNTB directory.  This directory was created when you
unpacked the NNTB tarball and should be called nntb-XX where XX is the NNTB
version.

Obtain the necessary perl modules.

Open the nntb.conf file in a text editor.  Edit it to your satisfaction and
then copy it to either /etc/nntb.conf or ~/.nntb .

See the README file in the subdirectory for your weblog (e.g. Slash/README
or Scoop/README) for information specific to that weblog.

Run it.  initscript.

========TROUBLESHOOTING========

If you get a permission denied error while trying to run nntb, try the
following command: chmod +x nntb

If you get an error about a bad interpreter while trying to run nntb, your perl
may not be installed in /usr/bin/perl.  Find out where your perl binary is located;
try commands like 'which perl', 'type -path perl', 'whereis perl', and
'locate perl | grep bin'.  Then, change the first line of nntb from #!/usr/bin/perl
to #!/path/to/your/perl

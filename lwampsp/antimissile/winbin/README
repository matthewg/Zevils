antimissile: Missile defense simulation
by Matthew Sachs, Daniel Ameli, and Bruce Einsohn
Created for Lawrence Woodmere Academy's BC Calculus class, 2002

        Researchers at MIT's Defense Lab have just completed a prototype
        ICBA (Intercontinental Ballistic Artillery) system.  Al Qaeda has
        broken into the lab and stolen the plans.  They've had time to
        bring a single ICBA battery online, and they are about to test it
        against Boston.  You must use the prototype ICBA in Boston to
        bring down their projectile.  However, due to environmental
        regulations, you must bring the projectile down not only over
        the Atlantic ocean, but over a precise spot in the Atlantic.
        
        1. Set the distance between Afghanistan and Boston.
        2. Set how long after A has fired it takes B to fire.
        3. Click "Fire A" to compute a random trajectory for A to hit B.
                The trajectory will be drawn on the screen as a red parabola.
        4. Click a spot on the trajectory where B must intersect the missile.
        5. Click "Go!" to see it in action!

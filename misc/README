g2export will grab all of the images from a Gallery 2 website,
preserving the album structure on the website as a folder structure on
the disk and taking file names from captions if available.

ul2shoplist is designed as an iPhone bookmarklet for doing shopping
lists.  It takes the first unordered list on a page whose first list
item doesn't contain a class attribute and transforms all of the items
on that list into checkboxes; when the boxes are checked, they will
move to the end of the list, and they will return to their original
location if they're unchecked.  We do our shopping lists on a wiki,
and this is designed to work with that; the "first list item doesn't
contain a class attribute" restriction is so that it skips over the
"table of contents" list that MediaWiki puts in.  I used John Gruber's
bookmarklet script to convert it to a bookmarklet.

sms2txt and jotter are programs I wrote to export data from my P910
UIQ smartphone.

jotter takes a Jotter document database (in
C:\documents\Jotter\Jotter on the phone) on stdin and prints
the contents of the notes to stdout, separated by a line of dashes.

sms2txt takes a list of Mail files which contain SMS messages as
command-line arguments and generates an HTML table showing them all as one
conversation on standard output.  The SMS messages are in one of the folders under
<tt>C:\system\Mail</tt>.  It will need to be modified if you have
messages to/from multiple people in a folder; I had all my incoming
and outgoing messages to/from a single person in one folder.  I didn't
quite figure out how to determine if a message was incoming or
outgoing, so that part is a kludge based on some phone number in the
message which isn't the to/from phone number (the phone number of an
SMS gateway?); you'll probably need to adjust that.

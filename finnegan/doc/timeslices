Finnegan Timeslice Allocation Algorithm
---------------------------------------

Each use of a phone line requires the allocation of a timeslice
to a call.

Uses of a phone-line:
	-Wake-up calls
	-Lost PIN calls

We know when wake-up calls happen, except for snoozes.  We don't
know when lost PIN will happen.  Wake-up calls will hang up after
110 seconds.  PIN calls will hang up after 50.  Snoozes happen between 9
and 11 minutes after a wake-up call (snooze interval is 9 minutes), and
are capped at 4 snoozes (you can only hit the snooze button 3 times, effectively.)

The use of 110 and 50 seconds as opposed to 120/60 is to give a 10-second margin
for dialling the number, etc.  Calls are assumed to take 120/60 seconds.

finnegan will record actual data on how long things take, how many times
snooze is activated for each call, when people try to set wakes for 
unavailable times, etc, to see if we need to tweak things.

finnegan will skew the time of something by +/- 30 seconds if it needs
to in order to make a time available.  So, if someone has a call scheduled
for 9:07, and you want one scheduled for 9:06, it'll turn his into 9:07:30
and yours into 9:05:30.  The finnegan UI will only provide granularity of
minutes (so you can set a call for 9:07, but not 9:07:01.)

The number of timeslices which will be in use at any particular time t
can be computed by:
	sum(n=0->4): C(t-n*11*60, (t+120)-n*9*60)
where C(a, b) is the number of calls scheduled between times a and b.

Schedule for t=1000
	(t, t+120) {i: 120}
	(t-660, t-420) {i: 240}
	(t-1320, t-960) {i: 360}
	(t-1980, t-1500) {i: 480}

Yeah, that interval of 480 seconds really sucks, eh?  It's because
we don't know how long a call will take, and we're compounding that
4 times.  So, to check if it's ok to set a call for a particular time,
take:
	sum(n=0->3): C(t-n*11*60, (t+120)-n*9*60)
	sum(n=0->3): C(t+n*11*60, (t+120)+n*9*60)
and if it's less than the number of phone lines we have, we're groovy.

We currently (as of this writing) allow phonelines to be overcommitted
by a factor of two; that is, we allocate twice as many calls for a particular
instant as we have phonelines available.  In the worst-case scenario, this
will delay someone's wake-up call by a couple of minutes.

To schedule a lost PIN call, we check when the next wake-up call is,
and if we have a phoneline available and the next wake-up call is
more than 60 seconds in the future, a lost PIN call is sent out.

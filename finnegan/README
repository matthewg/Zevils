Finnegan, the Brandeis Student Union wake-up call system
========================================================

Overview and Security
---------------------

Finnegan consists of the following components:
	1) A database to hold wake-up call information
	2) A web page for editing this information online
	3) A voice-response system for editing this information via phone
	4) A daemon that runs in the background and makes wake-up calls

Do we want it to work for off-campus numbers?  If so, we need to either
get a billing number for it, or configure its extensions to not need billing
numbers.  This creates some security issues.

(Can we get UNet authentication for the online system?  If we can, 
 callbacks aren't necessary for online entry:)   

For security, it won't do anything without issuing a callback.  That is, for
any changes entered online, it will call the user's extension and say
"You have requested the following changes to your wake-up calls: blah blah blah.
Press 1 to confirm these changes."  This has the disadvantage that anyone with
access to the user's phone can modify their wake-up calls.  If that's not an
acceptable level of security, we could let people create a PIN.  We would then
need to add PIN management mechanisms, a way for people to reset their PIN if they
forget it... it gets complicated.

Do we want to issue callbacks for phone-submitted requests?  That is, when
it gets an incoming call, do we want it to check the caller-ID information
and say "Thank you for your call.  To verify your extension, the system will
call you back.  Please hang up now." and then do a call-back?  It is possible
to spoof caller ID information, although it isn't trivial.

I think we can probably get away with believing the caller ID info for
phone requests, and doing a call-back for web requests.  This is all assuming
that the VoIP system, the analog bridge, and the modem will all pass CID
information through.  If not, we'll probably need to do a "Please enter your
five-digit extension.  *beep boop boop beep beep*  Thank you.  Please hang up,
and the system will call you back shortly to verify your extension."

Types of Wakes
--------------

("Wake" == "Wake-up call", to differentiate it from, say, a verification callback.)
We should be able to both one-time and recurring wakes.  The user should be
able to make a recurring wake go out on any set of days-of-week, so you
might have one wake that goes out every {Monday, Wednesday, Thursday}, and another
that goes out on {Tuesday, Friday}.  Wakes should be able to work on the
standard calendar, standard calendar with no calls on national holidays,
or Brandeis calendar (e.g. honoring days we have off, and "Brandeis Mondays".)
The user should be able to do a one-time disable of a wake for the next ocurrence of
a particular day-of-week.  (e.g. "Don't wake me next Tuesday.")  The user should have
the option of having the wake do positive or negative snooze - that is, either
"press any button to have me call back in nine minutes", or "press any button to
*not* have me call back in nine minutes."  Maybe even "press pound star pound to
not have me call back in nine minutes."  If we want to be fancy, we could have
custom snooze intervals, but I don't think that's too critical.  If we're doing user
preferences, 24-hour time would be an option, too, but again, it's not
critical.

We should have a few different choices of "wake message".  For instance:
	1. "You have a requested a wake-up call for TIME.  [Snooze: It is now
		TIME.] Please wake up."
	2. "WAKE UP!!  WAKE UP!!  WAKE UP!!  It's TIME. [Snooze: You should've
		been up at TIME!]"
	3. "*sings* Wake up, wake up you sleepy-head.  Wake up, wake up, get out
		of bed!  It's TIME, honey, you should get up now.  [Snooze:
		You were supposed to get up at TIME.]"
or something like that.  The bits in [Snooze: ...] would only be said if
the alarm went off once and the user hit snooze (or didn't hit the right
button to disable the alarm.)  After the message, there would be some fixed
text:
	"You will be called again in nine minutes unless you press a button."
or:
	"Press any key if you would like to be called again in nine minutes."
and then, for recurring wakes:
	"This is wake-up call #WAKE_ID from Finnegan, the Brandeis Student
	 Union wake-up call system.  To deactivate this wake, dial x6WAKE."
or for one-time wakes:
	"This is a one-time wake-up call from Finnegan, the Brandeis Student
	 Union wake-up call system.  Dial x6WAKE to use Finnegan."
and then the wake message and the fixed text would repeat a fixed number of
times, at least two.

So, in summary, we have the following attributes for all wakes:
	-Extension
	-Time
	-Snooze +/-
	-Message
One-time wakes would have the following additional attribute:
	-Date
Recurring wakes would have the following additional attributes:
	-Normal Days of Week
	-Current Days of Week (so user can do one-time disables of a particular day)
	-Calendar Type (normal, normal w/o holidays, Brandeis)


Prototype IVR Design
--------------------

Here's a sketch of the interactive voice recognition system, for editing
wakes via phone.  We should have some careful timeouts to stop someone
from tying up one of the lines, since we won't have that many of them.
We have to consider scenarios such as someone dialing Finnegan, dropping
their phone on the floor in such a way that one of the buttons is held down,
and walking away.

[-Global Settings-]
	[No progress for 3 minutes: "I'm sorry, you seem to be having trouble.
	    Dial x6???? for help with Finnegan. [-Goodbye-]"]

	recurring wake: "on DAYS_OF_WEEK"] at TIME.
